Algorithm

1. Main functionality - footswitch

By pressing footswitch you move drill down. Speed setup produced
by variable resistor on tray's control. Pulling footswitch
up returns drill into its previous position. If you press down the
footswitch when drill haven't reach its starting position, it moves down
again and returns back on next pulling up.

If drill motor was off, pressing footswitch will also turn it on.

/*
 * the behaviour of steps counter depends on footswitch state; timer
 * setup varies due to varistor value.
 */


2. Tray buttons

2.1. Left button (BTN1) used to setup the zero point of drill: 
	- drill quickly moves up
	- stepper speed changes to lowest
	- while pressing down the footswitch motor moves down
	- press BTN1 again to set current position as zero-point

/*
 * Button control: by default, EXTI interrupts serve buttons.
 * To avoid clash, EXTI interrupt handler sets the special flag 
 * value to 50 (in milliseconds) and turns off EXTI IRQ.
 * In the main() body the endless cycle checks value of system
 * timer variable changed by system timer once per millisecond.
 * If the EXTI pause flag non-zero, it decrements it until zero.
 * After that EXTI turns on again and keys state occured. This
 * allows also to avoid some noice on MCU inputs.

2.2. Right button (BTN2) used to switch between regulation
of stepper speed or drill speed by variable resistor on tray's
control. The default state is stepper (vertical) speed regulation.

Drill works with algorithm of automatical moment correction:
if drill stalled, the PWM duty reduced until current through drill's
winding stabilize to max value. Conversely, when current through winding
falls to very low value, PWM duty increased until normal current
value. Varistor allows you to set these limiting values in drill speed
mode.

2.3. Simultaneous pressing of both buttons will:
	- stop drill motor
	- move tray up
	- move drill down

So, you can easily change drilling bits. After that press again BTN1+BTN2
to return tray down & drill motor up. After this operation the uppest
drill's position will be zero.
